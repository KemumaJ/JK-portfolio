        Welcome to my webpage! I hope you will enjoy reading and get to learn something about me. My background is in sales and marketing. 
        I have been in the sales environment for the better part of my work life. I enjoy interacting with customers because I believe 
        it is easier to retain happy customers than to acquire one. 
        In an effort to upskill myself, I decided to delve into the programming world. This is something I had never given thought to 
        while at school. My initial desire was to become a journalist. However, due to my dynamic way of thinking I shelved that thought 
        and decided to pursue marketing. I am also a trained digital marketing specialist. A few years back I tried my hand at blogging.

        <h4>
            My desire to pursue software engineering was born out of our organization's vision, which is to be a purpose-led Technology Company 
            by 2025. I had a quick mind shift and when the opportunity came to apply for the digital academy cohort 4, I quickly seized the moment 
            and applied. I am learning a lot and I believe the journey ahead is great!
